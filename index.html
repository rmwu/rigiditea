                <p>Welcome to Rigiditea, our humble little web app!</p>
                
                <p>
                Rigiditea is a simple web application for visualizing the pebble game algorithm,
                which determines the generic two-dimensional rigidity of an arbitrary unidrected graph.
                The algorithm works by building a maximal set of <em>independent edges</em>
                (i.e. edges that impose linearly independent constraints on the motion of the graph).
                A graph with 2<em>n</em> - 3 independent edges
                (corresponding to the 2<em>n</em> - 3 degrees of freedome)
                is generically rigid in two dimensions,
                so determining rigidity once we have a maximal independent set is trivial.
                </p>
                <p>
                The pebble game algorithm builds the maximal set in stages;
                at each stage, it tests whether it can add an edge to the independent set.
                The algorithm proceeds until all edges have been tried,
                at which point we have a maximal independent set.
                </p>
                <p>
                It happens that we can add an edge to the current independent set
                if and only if we can play the following pebble game successfully.
                In the graph consisting of the current independent set
                and the candidate edge,
                assign each vertex two pebbles;
                vertices can use their pebbles to cover edges incident to them.
                The objective is to cover each edge in the current independent set with one pebble
                and the candidate edge with four.
                </p>
                <p>
                We illustrate this algorithm here by allowing the user to step through it.
                At each stage, we mark the candidate indepedent edge
                and show the number of pebbles on each vertex and edge.

                To begin, design a graph.
                Click anywhere on the canvas to add a node,
                select two nodes to draw an edge with "edge" (keyboard shortcut "e")
                and click "delete" to remove selected nodes or edges (keyboard shortcut "x")
                Click an element again to deselect.
                </p>
                <p>
                Next, click "Pebble" or "Infinitesimal" to view the visualizations.
                Click "step" to advance your algorithm.
